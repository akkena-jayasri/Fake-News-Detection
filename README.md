- Uses a trained Naive Bayes model for prediction
- Simple and user-friendly interface

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

### Backend (Flask)
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/akkena-jayasri/Fake-News-Detection.git
- Add a python file that implements the Flask-based API to connect with the frontend which also handles data preprocessing and classification logic.
- Verify the backend is running: Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000. You should see a message indicating that the Fake News Detection API is running.

### Frontend (ReactJS)
- Navigate to the frontend directory and add the necessary logic in the App.js file.
- Start the React development server: npm start
- Verify the frontend is running: Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000. You should see the Fake News Detection application interface.

### Usage
